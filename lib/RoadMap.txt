What have been done for first day:
- Structure created-organised.
- Category and news tile models created.
- Over those models, data were shown to user.

What will be done:
- Image.network takes some time to load image. So I should find a way to show progress bar or faster model.
- onTop methods are did not implemented. with tapping, navigating to different screen should be done.
- In category detail screen, I should show articles to users which are relevant to tapped topic.
- In news detail screen, user will visit webpage screen. So I should look the implementation of how to do native things.
- Responsive UI should be searched.
